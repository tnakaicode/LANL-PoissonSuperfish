Los Alamos National Laboratory Poisson Superfish
Program Automesh written by James H. Billen and Lloyd M. Young

The original Poisson Superfish codes were developed
by Ron F. Holsinger in collaboration with Klaus Halbach.
These programs are provided as a service to the accelerator
community by the Los Alamos Accelerator Code Group (LAACG).
